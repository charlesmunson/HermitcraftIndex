About the Hermitcraft Index Project

This is a project to index content in the Hermitcraft series of videos, focusing on the current Season 6.  

We will be using React and GraphQL.

This is starting as a learning project for the creator. At some point, this may be opended up to public contributions, both in coding and indexing.
